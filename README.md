Scraping movie directors from a BBC list of movies, find out where is their birthplace and then map it using Mapbox GL.

**Programming languages used:** Python (Pandas, BeautifulSoup), Javascript.

**Step 1:** To create a list of movies and movie critics into a dataframe. The list was scraped from this website: http://floatingmedia.com/columbia/BBC.html

**Step 2:** Find out where directors from that list were born by scraping IMDB website - https://imdb.com/

**Step 3:** MAPPING with MAPBOX Using HERE (https://developer.here.com/) to get latitude and longitude. Use the information to create a Mapbox map using Javascript/HTML.

This was part of a final project for a introduction to programming class at [Columbia University/School of Journalism](https://journalism.columbia.edu/ms-data-journalism)

Final result:
![Where did the people who directed these movies born?](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AOFWGr9esU9dh-4hc84WZZF6aaFmsnlj/view?usp=sharing)
